###Project Description

This project is a replica of a smart parking lot system that visualizes users to determine if a parking spot is available or not prior to entering the parking lot. The LED Matrix allows users to see whether a specific parking spot is open or taken. It also portrays whether the parking lot is full, and if so, no car can enter the parking lot until a spot is available.
